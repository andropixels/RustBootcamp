// Topic: Organizing similar data using structs
//
// Requirements:
// * Print the flavor of a drink and it's fluid ounces
//// Create a struct Area length having one field length, create a function area_square which accepts the Area and returns the square of length, create a function volume which accepts the  Area and returns the cube of the length , call this function in main . 
// Notes:
// * Use an enum to create different flavors of drinks
// * Use a struct to store drink flavor and fluid ounce information
// * Use a function to print out the drink flavor and ounces
// * Use a match expression to print the drink flavor

fn main() {}
